    <span class="c1">I spent last weekend at the Bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose. It
    was quite huge, most estimates I see are on the order of 1000+ people. By the end of
    the weekend I'd lost my voice and was completely exhausted. I took part in two panels
    and one talk.</span><br />

        had.

          Hardware was a big theme this year.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li class="c4">There were of course ASIC mining units on display, but I think
          that's relatively uninteresting by now.<br />
          <br /></li>

          <li class="c4">Butterfly Labs have also been sponsoring the development of a
          TREZOR competitor, the <a href="http://imgur.com/EC7EBO4" target=
          "_blank"><strong>BitSafe</strong></a>. As a refresher, these devices are small
          units with a little black/white display in them and a couple of buttons. They
          plug in to a computer via USB and when you push the button, they sign payments
          with your Bitcoin private keys all using on board hardware. The display shows
          you what you're signing. Their limited nature means they should be virtually
          impossible to infect with malware.<br />
            <br />

            <div class="c5"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Z0FZPpM.jpg" alt=
            "Inline image 1" width="420" height="312" /></div><br />
            These devices are a key part of the plan to tackle compromised end user
            machines. Currently neither BitSafe nor TREZOR are shipping, but both teams
            appear to have hardware that is substantially complete. Most likely, version
            one of the devices won't support the payment protocol making them vulnerable
            to MITM substitution attacks, but later versions will be able to read the
            signed payment requests that will be deployed over the course of the
            year.<br />
            <br />
            The <a href="http://bitcointrezor.com/" target="_blank"><strong>TREZOR
            website</strong></a> has been updated with a video - they're pitching for
            Kickstarter funding to help them turn their prototype into a real shipping
            product. It's very nicely produced, you should check it out.<br />
            <br />
            Both BitSafe and TREZOR have open source firmwares, and Chris (who is doing
            BitSafe development) said he wanted the devices to all be compatible,
            although it's likely the first versions won't be quite there due to the rapid
            parallel development by teams separated by oceans.<br />
            <br />
            One issue Chris brought up that is quite insightful, is that the design makes
            getting money <em>out</em> of the devices secure, but there's no obvious way
            to get money <em>into</em> them safely if your computer is compromised. A
            reverse payment protocol may form part of the solution, but more research is
            needed.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
          </li>

          <li class="c4">Lamassu demonstrated their cute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070538/https://lamassu.is/"
            target="_blank"><strong>Bitcoin ATM</strong></a>. It's as easy to use as
            possible - you feed in bank notes via a slot, hold up your phones screen to a
            glass pane when it's showing a QRcode and the coins appear a few seconds
            later. Done! It's probably the slickest Bitcoin ATM yet.<br />
            <br />
            The biggest problem all these projects face is that deployment inside the USA
            is borderline impossible due to the fragmented and extremely bureaucratic AML
            licensing regime. Some states (like California) require bonds in excess of
            half a million dollars to be posted just to be able to apply for a license,
            let alone actually get one. Lamassu plan to just manufacture the devices and
            let others shoulder the compliance costs, although given that you can drop
            them more or less anywhere almost anonymously it will be interesting to see
            if guerilla ATMs crop up.<br />
            <br />
            Some people are planning to approach the problem by focusing on parts of the
            world where financial regulation is less dysfunctional - a few US states have
            very little required licensing, and Europe has a single market for regulatory
            compliance. In these areas the overall costs of compliance can be amortized
            over a much larger potential market. How exactly such machines will be
            compliant with vague and expansive AML regimes that boil down to "the
            government should know about every trade" is presently unclear but it's
            likely they will require "upgrades" that make them less convenient.<br />
            <br />

          </li>

          <li class="c4">The Mycelium Bitcoin Card folks were there, but once again they
          didn't want to demonstrate their hardware actually being switched on and
          operating. I'm getting kind of tired of this, their hardware has been around
          for a while in prototype form but they never seem anywhere close to actually
          showing a working transaction.<br /></li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <strong class="c3">Talks</strong>
        </div>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li class="c4"><strong>Gavin Andresen</strong> did a talk that was titled
            "State of the coin", but he said at the start there was far far too much
            going on to cover in a single talk, so instead he discussed core principles
            he thinks development should stick to. He talked about how to balance the
            need to experiment with the need for stability in the core system, mentioned
            the payment protocol work that he and I have been working on, mentioned again
            that he sees mobiles and tablets being more important than desktop/laptops in
            future and a few other pieces. It was all good albiet high level stuff.
            Quote: <em>"Bitcoin is a rollercoaster. I happen to enjoy
            rollercoasters."</em><br />
            <br /></li>

            <li class="c4">Pieter Wiulle did a talk on <strong>heirarchical deterministic
            wallets</strong> and announced that the spec was now finalised, with test
            vectors soon to come. Deterministic wallets are a critical piece of making
            "last chance" wallet backups work well, and the hardware wallets like BitSafe
            and TREZOR rely on them. They also open up many other useful applications and
            it's generally agreed that they're a big deal. So getting the standard
            finalised is a big step forward, as it opens the way to widespread
            implementation. There was some discussion of the difference between backing
            up wallets vs keys, and how best to handle key lookahead.<br />
              <br />

              <div class="c5"><img src=
              "https://web.archive.org/web/20151028013505/http://www.bitcoin2013.com/uploads/1/4/9/4/14946598/2315015_orig.jpeg"
              alt="Inline image 4" width="420" height="279" /></div><br />
            </li>

            <li class="c4">I moderated a panel on the future of Bitcoin, which covered
            various topics like coloured coins, smart property, how Bitcoin impacts tax
            collection, contracts and how governments might react to micro-futures, along
            with many other things. I also took part in an implementors panel where the
            difficulty of finding people to help with testing and QA was a repeated theme
            from Gavin.<br />
            <br /></li>

            <li class="c4">There was a fascinating talk from <strong>Dr. Eli
            Ben-Sasson</strong> of Technion University, on the topic of <strong>provable
            computation</strong>. He made the remarkable claim that his (large,
            international) team was on the verge of releasing a new system that allowed
            any arbitrary C program to be compiled down to a form that accepted private
            inputs and when run, would produce a signature proving the execution was
            correct in the face of a malicious adversary ..... that is efficient enough
            to be usable. He calls it "<a href=
            "https://citp.princeton.edu/event/braverman/" target="_blank">succinct
            computational integrity</a>".<br />
            <br />
            This capability has apparently been around for some time, the problem being
            that the algorithms all had complexity exponential <em>or worse</em> in the
            running time of the program - Ben-Sasson claims they have found a way to
            convert this to polylog time. From a users perspective they have a magic GCC
            backend that compiles C programs to bytecode for a custom VM, and the proofs
            can be checked efficiently enough to run on smartphones. Release is expected
            later this year, in two phases.<br />
            <br />
            We spent some time brainstorming ways in which this could apply to Bitcoin -
            unfortunately the only ways we could come up with were relatively trivial. It
            would intuitively seem like many uses of trusted computing could be replaced
            by this technique, but the inability to shield keys from the remote side
            means it isn't a total replacement. Whitebox crypto in conjunction with SCI
            might be an interesting avenue to explore.<br /></li>
          </ul>

          <div>
            There were many other talks that I didn't get a chance to attend.<br />
          </div>

          <div>
            <br />

          </div>

          <div>
            A few core developers got together and hung out for an hour or so. We spent a
            lot of time dreaming up tasks to fill Jeff Garzik's plate now he's able to
            focus on core development full time, thanks to BitPay. We agreed that deeper
            insight into <strong>real-time network metrics</strong> was a serious need,
            right now we don't have good graphs of things like tx or block propagation
            times.
          </div>

          <div>
            <br />
          </div>

          <div>
            We talked about adding some stats reporting to the protocol so we could
            understand performance bottlenecks. We also discussed <strong>increasing
            block sizes</strong> - there was consensus that we need to explore what
            happens when the software is put under heavy load as part of this process,
            for example, by generating artificial loads on the testnet. One idea that
            came up was replaying transactions from the main network at
            faster-than-real-time into the testnet, but unfortunately that won't work due
            to the dependencies on the coinbase transactions. It seems likely that there
            may be unexpected bottlenecks like the maxlocks problem, so there's a clear
            need to stay ahead of those. Unexpected complexity blowup in getblocktemplate
            was mentioned.
          </div>

          <div>
            <br />
          </div>

          <div>
            We felt that the apparently endless arguments around block sizes would become
            much simpler once more data was obtained. Gavin plans to start building
            consensus on the exact mechanism for larger blocks over the rest of this
            year. He gave estimates of transaction volumes that indicate we have until
            the end of the year before reaching the 1mb limit, although we also agreed
            growth is likely to be highly unpredictable and non-linear.
          </div>

          <div>
            <br />
          </div>

          <div>
            We also discussed the recent dramas around the <strong>fee changes</strong> -
            Bitcoin as an open source project is breaking new ground in how such projects
            are run. The press center and generally improved sophistiction of our media
            strategy is one example of something that's rare for an open source project.
            Now we're finding that some people feel protocol changes that are discussed
            only on github are being "hidden" from the community by virtue of the fact
            that github is only frequented by developers. This was talked about briefly,
            the possibility of more frequent updates posted to the forums or the
            Foundation blog was brought up. Whilst nobody thinks Gavin did anything wrong
            here, it's clear that the Bitcoin userbase has been changing rapidly and is
            now dominated by people who have no experience of open source software
            development yet have opinions about how the technology works regardless.
            Figuring out what to do about that is an ongoing challenge.

            <strong>Exchanges:</strong> The conference was a remarkably positive affair
            despite the news of the DHS action against an exchange account held by Mt Gox
            earlier in the week. In fact, Mt Gox had hardly any presence at all despite
            their central position in the ecosystem. Many people commented that the
            community needed more exchanges, and I talked to several people who indicated
            they were working on opening up new exchanges. The recent (apparently
            permanent) 10x price increase, some modicum of clarity from regulators and
            the added legitimacy brought by large VC investments is making it feasible
            for the first time to actually think about being compliant <em>first</em>,
            and setting up the business afterwards, something that wasn't really possible
            when the space was so much smaller and less proven. TradeHill is back with an
            innovative legal strategy - they only deal with accredited investors this
            time around, which apparently changes the regulatory requirements for the
            better. They actually brought a notary to the conference so they could sign
            up accredited investors right on the spot. One guy, Bennett Hoffman, is
            trying to develop open source exchange software so the infrastructure side of
            running an exchange gets easier.
          </div>

          <div>
            A complaint I heard several times is that there are people who badly want to
            <strong>invest in developing the Bitcoin ecosystem</strong>, but connecting
            people with money to people who can convert it into infrastructure upgrades
            is difficult. Many of the people who have the necessary programming
            experience are already maxed out and the complex design spaces occupied by
            many wanted upgrades means finding talent is hard. I spent some time
            brainstorming with a few guys who represented "the money" on how to solve it.
            I suggested that one solution would be a move away from the bounty model with
            its vague requirements and duplicative competition to carefully specced
            contracts signed with developers who may not be core Bitcoin designers but
            can be trusted to write good code to spec. The specifications can then be
            written by trusted community members who understand what it takes to, for
            example, design comprehensive dispute mediation or deploy new security
            features. Jim Burton told me he has set up a new company and is considering
            trying to help solve this problem.

            A lot of people wanted to know how <strong>Ripple, Litecoin, and
            Bitcoin</strong> interact. I spent a lot of time giving answers to this one
            :-) Ripple had a booth there and the designer of Litecoin was also present,
            but I think he's been taken by surprise at the fact that it's taken off.

          <div>
            There was a ton of interest in <strong>contracts</strong>, and it's not just
            because I'm known for developing them - lots of panels and general QA
            sessions had people asking questions about Bitcoin's advanced features. A
            common question was, "<em>why aren't these apps here yet</em>" to which
            there's no good answer beyond "<em>the programming involved is quite
            difficult</em>". There was often an undercurrent of impatience here - people
            want these apps but we need to make building them easier. Bitcoinj is a good
            platform on which to do this. I'll try and make some time this summer to
            write articles and example apps for bitcoinj showing how to do basic tasks
            needed for building contract protocols, as right now I'm basically giving
            tutorials in things like partially signing transactions over email.

            The conference was fantastic and tremendously well run, kudos to Lindsay, our
            one-woman wonder organiser. Once again I found myself amazed both by
            Bitcoin's rapid growth and the incredible amount that is being achieved on
            the back of shoestring budgets. The number and quality of the conversations
            exceeded that of any other conference I've been to by far.

            A nice thing to note is the changing gender ratio - the Bitcoin community is
            growing and more women are getting involved along the way, often by being
            hired by Bitcoin businesses to handle the non-technical side, or through
            working for the media. There are some great stories of how people end up a
            part of the community, often kind of randomly - the girl who handles merchant
            approvals for BitPay started out as a waitress at a restaurant frequented by
            the (now) CEO. She was the only one willing to deal with the hassle of
            accepting this crazy currency only one customer+his friends wanted to pay
            with, now she's working for a cashflow-positive startup that's adding
            customers at a fast pace. Good move!
